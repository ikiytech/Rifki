## ðŸŒŸ About Me

Hey there, I'm Muhammad Rifki, a sophomore majoring in Informatics. I have a strong passion for coding, especially in FrontEnd Web development and data analysis. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies to explore and challenging projects to tackle.

My goal is to become a versatile developer who can make a significant impact. I've used Python with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze and visualize large datasets, such as customer behavior, creating charts and graphs that convey valuable insights.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new places. Currently, I'm working on building a personal data analysis dashboard using Streamlit and am excited about diving into machine learning next.
